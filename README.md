Then name your VM and choose the Azure region that's right for you and your customers. Keep in mind the not all VM sizes are available in all regions. After that, set your security type to standard. Next you'll choose the base operating system or application for the VM.

Once your image is chosen, select a VM size to support the workload that you want to run. The size you choose will determines factors such as processing power, memory, speed and storage capacity. Azure offers a myriad of sizes to support different types of uses at varying hourly prices.

Next you'll create an Administrator account. You'll use this account to log in to your VM. Before you finish check the Licensing box and finally on the bottom left of the page select Review & create. On the following page the site will review all your credentials and if your validation passes, you can select create and deploy your virtual machine.
